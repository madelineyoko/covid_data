# COVID-19 Dataset
### Alex the Analyst Portfolio Series  
  
## Project Overview
Alex Freberg created a Portfolio Project Series on his youtube channel, Alex the Analyst. The playlist for these tutorials can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst).  
  
This repo is storing the results of myself following along to 3/4 videos, exploring and visualizing Covid-19 data using SQL and Tableau, as well as cleaning data with SQL using a nashville housing dataset. I will be storing the queries I reproduced from Alex's videos as well as some of my own which I used for further exploration and viz's on the COVID-19 data.
